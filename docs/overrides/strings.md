# String Overrides

The strings shown in the HTML reader are localisable to enable editions to be shown in different languages.
There is also the ability to override the default strings used by the HTML reader in this branding pack via the `customStringsPack.json` file.
This file is read by the HTML reader and any strings included in it are used as overrides for the defaults.
Crucially, this means you only have to include the strings you want to change, missing strings will simply use the value in the default pack.
The current default English values are as follows (in JSON format):
