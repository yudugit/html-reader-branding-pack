# Publicly Accessible APIs

As well as the [submodules API](../api/api.md), the HTML reader exposes some internal APIs publicly.
These are intended to provide useful mechanics to third-party scripts running anywhere on page, without necessarily needing a full branding pack implementation.

Note that documentation on these APIs is provided here as a point of reference, rather than an authoritative source.
